# Work Journal

This is my personal work journal.

## Get started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/marekzelinka/work-journal.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Define required env variables:

   - Copy the template contents in [.env.example](.env.example) to a new file named `.env` and fill all the required fields.

4. Run the application in dev mode:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Goals

Practice working with Remix [data loadings APIs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/data-loading) and [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/).

## Credits

- App idea from [Build UI](https://buildui.com/courses/ship-an-app-with-remix) Remix course, called [Ship an app with Remix](https://buildui.com/courses/ship-an-app-with-remix)
